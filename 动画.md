官方向导[Animating Views Using Scenes and Transitions](https://developer.android.google.cn/training/transitions/index.html)

## 几个概念：
> A scene defines a given state of an application’s UI, whereas a transition defines the animated change between two scenes.

The basic process to animate between two layouts is as follows:

1. Create a Scene object for both the starting layout and the ending layout. However, the starting layout's scene is often determined automatically from the current layout.
2. Create a Transition object to define what type of animation you want.
3. Call TransitionManager.go() and the system runs the animation to swap the layouts.


创建Scene
    1. 从静态布局创建
    2. 代码动态创建

Transition
    种类： Auto， Fading， changeBounds

    1. <fade xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" />
    2. 
        Transition mFadeTransition =
        TransitionInflater.from(this).
        inflateTransition(R.transition.fade_transition);

    3. 代码动态创建
        Transition mFadeTransition = new Fade();

不使用场景
    使用条件： view变化前后对象树差不多

    To create a delayed transition within a single view hierarchy, follow these steps:

    1. When the event that triggers the transition occurs, call the TransitionManager.beginDelayedTransition() method providing the parent view of all the views you want to change and the transition to use. The framework stores the current state of the child views and their property values.
    2. Make changes to the child views as required by your use case. The framework records the changes you make to the child views and their properties.
    3. When the system redraws the user interface according to your changes, the framework animates the changes between the original state and the new state.a

    代码示例：
    // Create a new TextView and set some View properties
    mLabelText = new TextView();
    mLabelText.setText("Label").setId("1");

    // Get the root view and create a transition
    mRootView = (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.mainLayout);
    mFade = new Fade(IN);

    // Start recording changes to the view hierarchy
    TransitionManager.beginDelayedTransition(mRootView, mFade);

    // Add the new TextView to the view hierarchy
    mRootView.addView(mLabelTex)
